      <title>Redesign and rewrite Piper for Google Summer of Code 2017</title>

      <description>I redesigned and rewrote the Piper mouse configuration tool for the GNOME desktop environment under the guidance of Peter Hutterer from the X.Org Foundation. You can read the project page and browse the development series that I wrote during the project for more information.
As a result of my Google Summer of Code, I am now the maintainer of Piper. I also regularly contribute to its dependencies, libratbag and ratbagd.</description>

      <title>Google Summer of Code proposal contributions</title>

      <description>The application process of Google Summer of Code requires students to make a small contribution to the project(s) of their choice to demonstrate that they are capable of making a change following the upstream submission procedures. In my understanding, this is less about the actual code than it is about demonstrating these skills. This is (partly, the other reason being that as I was working on these proposals I was also finishing up several course projects) the reason that the contributions here are rather small:</description>

      <description>Besides working on my own applications, I contribute to several existing open source projects. I find this to be a good way to learn from experienced developers, and it is very satisfactory knowing that your work will be used by more than a few people! Below you find a (probably incomplete, as I will likely forget some) list of contributions.</description>

      <description>For the course Software Architecture at the TU Delft we were required to analyse and contribute to an existing open source project. The group I was part of chose Neovim as our project. The result of this analysis is a chapter in the book Delft Students on Software Architecture: 2017.
Our contributions resulted in several small fixes to both Neovim and Vim:
 Neovim commits by myself and Sander; Vim commits by myself.</description>
