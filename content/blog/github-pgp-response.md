A few weeks ago I wrote about adding a [new PGP subkey to your GitHub account](/blog/psa-github-gpg).
I reported this issue to GitHub when I discovered it. Today, I have gotten a response from GitHub:

So, perhaps this will work properly in the future, or at least be
documented behavior â˜º I have now also [reported this issue to
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/55864), which I
forgot to do earlier because I had a plane to catch.
