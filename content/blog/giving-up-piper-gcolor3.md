Today, I handed over the maintainership of Gcolor3 to [Christopher
Davis](https://wiki.gnome.org/ChristopherDavis), also known as Brainblasted. As
you may have noticed, I have little time (and to be honest, little interest) to
keep Gcolor3 up to date. 

Gcolor3 was my first project and still a project I'm proud of, but it is time
for me to move on. It's not easy to give over the maintainership, but it's the
best thing to do for both the project and myself: users shouldn't have to wait
days or weeks for me to respond, and I shouldn't have to feel guilty and
pressured whenever I get a notification.

Chris has provided some merge requests for Gcolor3 over the last few months and
has been building quite the profile for himself within the GNOME community. As
such, I feel confident that Chris will do a great job: Chris has already merged
several commits that fix multiple issues since I gave him access to the
repository! (One particularly balsy move is to rename the project only hours
after taking over ðŸ˜‰). This has only solidified my decision, so; thank you,
Chris! I am excited to see where you'll take Gcolor3.

For similar reasons, three months ago I have given up my maintainership of
Piper.  I hadn't been active in the Piper or libratbag projects for a while and
similar to Gcolor3, I had little time nor interest to stay involved.

It took me a while to realize, but over time, your motivations and interests
change, and that is totally fine.  However, you owe it to yourself and your
projects to admit that: users shouldn't have to wait for your attention and you
shouldn't have to feel guilty whenever someone reaches out to you. 

Thank you to all Gcolor3 contributors, to all Piper and libratbag maintainers
and to Peter Hutterer, Benjamin Tissoires and Christopher Davis in particular!
