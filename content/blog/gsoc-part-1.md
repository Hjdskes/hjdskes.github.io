Yesterday, after waiting for what felt like a very long time, I finally got the
results of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) application! I can happily say that
one of my proposals has been accepted: I will work with [Peter
Hutterer](https://who-t.blogspot.nl/) to redesign and rewrite
[Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper). The synopsis of my proposal is as
follows:

> Piper is an application frontend to libratbag and ratbagd, a library and
> system daemon to configure gaming mice respectively. In its current state
> Piper is not user friendly and lacks support for features found in many modern
> gaming mice.  This project aims to reimplement Piper such that it is more user
> friendly and can support these missing new features.

Examples of such missing features are button remapping, LED assignment and profiles.

I intend to write a blog post roughly every two weeks to keep you up to date on
my progress as I go. Blogging will force me to collect my thoughts and review my
progress (it will, hopefully, function as my [rubber
ducky](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) -- so that I won't have to (ab)use my
girlfriend). I hope that it will give you an incremental overview of my progress
and perhaps I can inspire those of you that may want to take on a similar
project but find it daunting to start somewhere.

This blog post is the start of a [series](/series/google-summer-of-code/). You can read the next
part about the community bonding period [here](/blog/gsoc-part-2).
