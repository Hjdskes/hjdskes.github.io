Gcolor3 has moved from GitHub to GNOME's GitLab instance! You can now
find the repository at https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3. This
was suggested by GNOME developer Jeremy Bicha and finalized very
quickly by Carlos Soriano, thanks both!

Being on GNOME's GitLab is awesome, because Gcolor3 is now surrounded
by other GNOME projects. This should make it easier to find for many
people, but there are other benefits too. Since the move yesterday, I
have already received nine merge requests! Granted, eight were from
the same developer, but it's very encouraging to see this amount of
contribution so early! What's more, Gcolor3 will now be able to
receive translations from GNOME's Translation teams!

We can now also use GNOME GitLab's continuous integration services to
test Gcolor3. This will require making Gcolor3 testable, and actually
writing tests. I have opened [an
issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3/issues/108) for this; if
this is something that interests you, then please do take a look!

In other news, I have released [version
2.3.1](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3/tags/v2.3.1). The
previous release did not include correct URLs to the screenshots in
the AppData file. I also quickly improved the saved colors page a bit
after a [suggestion by GNOME's
LapoC](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/9c5mvk/today_i_released_gcolor3_version_23/e58h9s1/)
to make it more alike other applications on Reddit. This release also
includes two contributions by Tobias Kortkamp from FreeBSD, to get
Gcolor3 working on FreeBSD, thanks!
