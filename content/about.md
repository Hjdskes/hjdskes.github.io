+++

I am a master student in Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology.
In the third year of my bachelor (Computer Science at the Delft University of
Technology), I have studied in Stockholm, Sweden for six months at the KTH Royal
Institute of Technology. In the field of Computer Science, my interests are
broad. Mainly, however, I am interested in operating systems, distributed
systems and programming languages.  I am currently working on my MSc thesis at
the Programming Languages group of the TU Delft under the supervision of [Dr.
S.T. Erdweg](www.erdweg.org) and [Sven Keidel](https://svenkeidel.de). I live in
Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

A great passion of mine is free and open-source software, to which I contribute
in several ways. I have been using Linux for over ten years and participate in
several Linux-related communities. This includes being a moderator at the
[Crunchbang Linux forum](http://crunchbang.org/forums/index.php) and the
[BunsenLabs Linux forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/index.php). When the
Crunchbang Linux project
[ended](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916), I played a role in
[forming](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39049) the [BunsenLabs
community continuation](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/). In 2017, I participated in
Google's Summer of Code. I have written a [series of blog posts](/series/gsoc/)
about my summer.

I also maintain several open-source applications [myself](/projects/) and
contribute patches to [other](/contributions/) open-source projects. Also see my
[GitHub](https://github.com/Hjdskes) page and my [GitHub
resum√©](https://resume.github.io/?Hjdskes).
