+++

I am a master student in Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology.
I currently live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. During the third year of my
bachelor (Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology), I have
studied in Stockholm, Sweden for six months at the KTH Royal Institute of
Technology.

In the field of Computer Science, my interests are broad. Mainly, however, I am
interested in operating systems, distributed systems and programming languages.

My greatest passion is open-source software, to which I strive to contribute in
several different ways. I have been using Linux for over five years and
participate in several Linux-related communities. This includes being a
moderator at the [Crunchbang Linux
forum](http://crunchbang.org/forums/index.php) and the [BunsenLabs Linux
forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/index.php). When the Crunchbang Linux
project [ended](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916), I played a
role in [forming](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39049) the
[BunsenLabs community continuation](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/).

I also maintain several open-source applications [myself](/projects/) and
contribute patches to [other](/contributions/) open-source projects. Also see my
[GitHub resumé](https://resume.github.io/?Hjdskes).
