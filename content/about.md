+++

I am a master student in Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology.
I currently live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. During the third year of my
bachelor (Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology), I have
studied in Stockholm, Sweden for six months at the KTH Royal Institute of
Technology.

In the field of Computer Science, my interests are broad. Mainly, however, I am
interested in operating systems, distributed systems and programming languages.

My greatest passion is open-source software, to which I contribute in several
ways. I have been using Linux for over ten years and participate in several
Linux-related communities. This includes being a moderator at the [Crunchbang
Linux forum](http://crunchbang.org/forums/index.php) and the [BunsenLabs Linux
forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/index.php). When the Crunchbang Linux
project [ended](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916), I played a
role in [forming](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39049) the
[BunsenLabs community continuation](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/).

I also maintain several open-source applications [myself](/projects/) and
contribute patches to [other](/contributions/) open-source projects. Also see my
[GitHub](https://github.com/Hjdskes) page and my [GitHub
resum√©](https://resume.github.io/?Hjdskes).
