+++

I am a Master of Science (*ir.*, see
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_degree#The_Netherlands))
in Computer Science.  I completed both my bachelor and master in Computer
Science at the Delft University of Technology.  In the last year of my bachelor,
I studied at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden for six
months. Within the field of Computer Science, my interests are broad. Mainly,
however, I am interested in operating systems and programming languages.  I
completed my [MSc thesis](/projects/msc/) at the [Programming Languages
group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology/programming-languages/)
of the TU Delft under the supervision of [Dr. S.T.
Erdweg](http://www.erdweg.org) and [Sven Keidel](https://svenkeidel.de). I live
in Stockholm, Sweden.

A great passion of mine is free and open-source software. I [enjoy](/projects/)
contributing to other projects and maintaining projects of my own.  In 2017, I
participated in Google's Summer of Code about which I have written a [series of
blog posts](/series/google-summer-of-code/). I am the maintainer of
[Piper](/projects/piper), [Gcolor3](/projects/gcolor3) and
[Cage](/projects/cage).

I have been using Linux for over ten years and participate in several
Linux-related communities. This includes being a moderator at the [Crunchbang
Linux](https://web.archive.org/web/20150207013657/http://crunchbang.org/) forum
when it still existed and the [BunsenLabs Linux
forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/index.php). When the Crunchbang Linux
project
[ended](https://web.archive.org/web/20150914181039/http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916),
I [played a
role](https://web.archive.org/web/20150914162213/http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39049)
in forming the [BunsenLabs community continuation](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/).
