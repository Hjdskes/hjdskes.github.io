I was cleaning up old GitHub repositories and came across old patches for GNOME
screenshot (see below). In an attempt to upstream them once more, I found that
most of these fixes had already found their way into GNOME screenshot, except
one. I opened a [merge
request](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-screenshot/merge_requests/4) for
that patch, which was accepted after a small change.
