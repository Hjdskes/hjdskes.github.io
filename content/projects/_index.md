I maintain several open-source applications of my own. I also do
course projects for university. Below you will find a list of projects
I think are worth mentioning. Please browse through my
<a href="https://github.com/Hjdskes/repositories" title="Hjdskes' repositories on GitHub" rel=me>GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/users/hjdskes/projects" title="Hjdskes' repositories on GNOME GitLab" rel=me>GNOME GitLab</a>
repositories for an exhaustive list.
