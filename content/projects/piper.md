[Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper) is a graphical user interface to
configure gaming mice. Configuration options include changing the resolution
(DPI) of the mouse, adding and removing profiles, changing button behaviors and
setting LED colors.

Piper requires [libratbag](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag)’s `ratbagd`,
the daemon to actually communicate with the mice. Piper is a just front end to
`ratbagd`.
