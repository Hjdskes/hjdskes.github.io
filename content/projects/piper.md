I redesigned and rewrote the [Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper) mouse
configuration tool for the GNOME desktop environment under the guidance of Peter
Hutterer from the X.Org Foundation. You can read the [project
page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=Piper\#6602376195604480)
and browse the [development series](/series/google-summer-of-code/) that I wrote during the
project for more information.

As a result of my Google Summer of Code, I am now the maintainer of Piper. I
also regularly contribute to its dependencies,
[libratbag](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag) and
[ratbagd](https://github.com/libratbag/ratbagd).
