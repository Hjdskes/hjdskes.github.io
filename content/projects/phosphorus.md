+++

[Phosphorus](https://github.com/Hjdskes/phosphorus) is a wallpaper browser and
setter in the spirit of [Nitrogen](https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen). It can be
considered an unofficial port of Nitrogen to GTK+ 3. Phosphorus is different,
however, in that it is plugin-based. This allows it be agnostic as to how the
wallpaper is actually applied -- each Desktop Environment has its own plugin
with this functionality.
