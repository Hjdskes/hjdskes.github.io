[Arek Window Manager](https://github.com/Hjdskes/arek-wm) is a plugin to
[Mutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutter_(software)) in an (ambitious)
attempt to create a tiling window manager with eye-candy. Due to several
limitations on Mutter's side, a moving Wayland target and a lack of time on my
side, this project is not actively maintained at the moment.
