[GTimeUtils](https://github.com/Hjdskes/gtimeutils) is a collection of simple
and small time utilities, namely a stopwatch and a (countdown) timer.

From version 2.0 onwards, both the timer and the stopwatch are of from [GNOME
Clocks'](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Clocks) respective stack pages. Prior to
version 2.0, both utilities served more as a practice than anything else. Since
I like the modern look of GNOME Clocks, but dislike the fact that all its
functionality is combined into one application, I have re-purposed GNOME Clocks'
ui files into standalone utilities.
