My Wayland compositor Cage is built on top of
[wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots), the "pluggable, composable,
unopinionated modules for building a Wayland compositor". Hence I contribute
fixes upstream. My commits can be found
[here](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/commits/master?author=Hjdskes), issues
and pull requests can be found
[here](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3AHjdskes+).
