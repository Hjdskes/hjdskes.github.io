Besides working on my own applications, I contribute to several existing open
source projects. I find this to be an excellent way to learn from experienced
developers. It is also very satisfactory knowing that your work will be used by
more than a few people! Below you find a (probably incomplete, as I will likely
forget some) list of contributions.
