I wrote some as of yet unmerged patches and opened some outstanding bug reports
to [GNOME Screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Screenshot). You can
review them [here](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748449) and
[here](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759265).

Until the patches are merged (if ever), you can find them in my
[fork](https://github.com/Hjdskes/gnome-screenshot) on GitHub.
