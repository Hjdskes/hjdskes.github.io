I wrote some as of yet unmerged patches and opened some outstanding bug reports
to [GNOME Screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Screenshot). You can
review them [here](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748449) and
[here](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759265).

Last week (september 22, 2018), I was cleaning up old GitHub
repositories and came across these patches again. In an attempt to
upstream them once more, I found that most of these fixes had already
found their way into GNOME screenshot, except one. I opened a [merge
request](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-screenshot/merge_requests/4)
for that patch, which was accepted after a small change.
