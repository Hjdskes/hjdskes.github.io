Besides working on my own applications, I contribute to several
existing open source projects. I find this to be a good way to learn
from experienced developers, and it is very satisfactory knowing that
your work will be used by more than a few people! Below you find a
list of contributions (probably incomplete, as I will likely forget
some).
