<p>This week I have been solving more issues to make sure that Piper offers a
pleasent user experience, doesn&rsquo;t crash and runs smoothly. My mentor and
cvuchener from the libratbag project have been testing Piper the last week, and
together with a handful of users attracted to Piper they have opened a bunch of
issues for me to solve. Let&rsquo;s run through the most visible ones!</p>

<h2 id="solving-global-warming">Solving global warming</h2>

<p>Probably the most fun issue to resolve this week was the one reported by my
mentor: <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/133">Piper contributes to global
warming</a> (<q>you won&rsquo;t believe
what happened next!</q>). The issue here was that when the MouseMap is partially
or fully obscured by another window, Piper&rsquo;s CPU usage would touch the 100% and
hence, contribute to global warming. Since global warming is bad (and yes, it
<em>is</em> real &#128521;), obviously I had to fix it.</p>

<p>The report already contained a hint as to what was happening: the MouseMap&rsquo;s
<code>do_draw</code> method was being called <em>a lot</em> (with some imprecise measurements, I
got it to roughly every 30 milliseconds). Through some more debugging I found
that the issue went away if we didn&rsquo;t retrieve the theme&rsquo;s color for links from
the MouseMap&rsquo;s
<a href="https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/StyleContext.html"><code>StyleContext</code></a>.
Gtk&rsquo;s baedert on <code>gtk+</code> linked me to <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760462">this old bug
report</a> that explains what&rsquo;s
going on. What follows here is my summary of the <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2015/11/20/a-gtk-update/">linked blog
post</a>, that goes into
more detail than the bug report:</p>

<p>Since Gtk 3.18, passing a state other than the current state to
<code>Gtk.StyleContext::get_color</code> isn&rsquo;t recommended and can, apparently, lead to
hogging the CPU due to triggering a loop: requesting the style context&rsquo;s color
triggers a pixel cache refresh, which triggers <code>do_draw</code>, which requests the
style context&rsquo;s color, et cetera.</p>

<p>The fix, then, is straightforward: save and restore the style context around
requesting a color, so that it won&rsquo;t be invalidated and won&rsquo;t trigger a pixel
cache refresh. Indeed, this is the suggested (temporary) workaround given in the
linked blog post; the given permanent solution is to use the <code>gtk_render_*</code> API.
However, this doesn&rsquo;t apply for the MouseMap and as such, I <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/135/files">used the
workaround</a> to do my share of
saving the planet.</p>

<h2 id="preventing-the-user-from-shooting-themselves-in-the-foot">Preventing the user from shooting themselves in the foot</h2>

<p>During GUADEC my mentor opened the issue that <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/82">we shouldn&rsquo;t allow a user to
unset the left mouse button</a>,
because if they do without mapping another button to a left mouse click they
won&rsquo;t have a left mouse click anymore and that&rsquo;s&hellip; well, troublesome to say the
least. The only question was how to best do this: randomly mapping
another button to a left mouse click was undesirable (for obvious reasons) but
we also shouldn&rsquo;t outright disallow remapping the (physical) left mouse button
as there are perfectly valid scenarios to do so. Think, for example, of left
handed users (yours truly) that swap the left- and right mouse buttons to use
the mouse with their left hand (not yours truly).</p>

<p>My first attempt then was to pop up a dialog that asks the user if they know
what they&rsquo;re doing <em>when we detect there isn&rsquo;t another button mapped to a left
mouse click</em> when they are attempting to remap the only/last button that is
mapped to a left mouse click (savvy?). I suppressed the voice in my head that
says dialogs are invasive and should be avoided, because I thought this was a
good compromise between protecting the user while still giving them all the
options. (As a sidenote, an undo button wouldn&rsquo;t work either because when the
last left mouse click has been unmapped, there is no left mouse click to press
undo with anymore).</p>

<p>I quickly implemented a <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/113">proof of
concept</a>, but my mentor was
stronger than I was and didn&rsquo;t give in to the dialog. Instead, he said we should
for now <strong>only</strong> allow to swap the left- and right mouse buttons; we&rsquo;ll hear it
from the users when they want more options. After two design iterations, this is
what I&rsquo;ve settled on:</p>

<p>The relevant pull requests are
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/117">#117</a> for the initial
implementation and <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/143">#143</a>
(unmerged) for the UI rework.</p>

<p>Another way to shoot yourself in the foot is by assigning a button in one
profile to cycle through profiles but not in another: eventually, you&rsquo;ll get
stuck in that profile with no way out but to open Piper. In the heat of battle
where either it&rsquo;s you or them, obviously you don&rsquo;t want this to happen. This is
exactly why my mentor <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/78">reported this
issue</a>, again over GUADEC, and,
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/112">as of last week</a>, this won&rsquo;t
happen and Piper is just that bit smarter!</p>

<h2 id="preventing-piper-from-crashing">Preventing Piper from crashing</h2>

<p>Libratbag contributor cvuchener reported <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Acvuchener">a bunch of
issues</a>
last week, in all of which Piper was crashing.</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/120">Piper was crashing when opening devices with weird
profiles</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>A profile containing an unsupported special button mapping crashed Piper, and</li>
<li>A device with profiles that did not have an active resolution set.</li>
</ol>

<p>With Piper being a graphical user interface to libratbag it naturally cannot
support anything that libratbag doesn&rsquo;t, but it also shouldn&rsquo;t crash when it
<em>does</em> see something that isn&rsquo;t supported. In this case, the solution is to
recognize that there <em>are</em> unsupported actions and to simply <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/121">add the
<code>RatbagdButton.ACTION_SPECIAL_UNKNOWN</code> entry to the
map</a> in the bindings that maps
special button mappings to their human readable representation.</p>

<p>While testing this, my device suddenly got a special button mapping with value
4294967295 (you&rsquo;ll have to take my word for this value not having any
significance within libratbag). As it turns out, libratbag (or ratbagd) doesn&rsquo;t
perform a range check and can thus let arbitrary special button mappings go
through instead of setting or returning <code>RatbagdButton.ACTION_SPECIAL_UNKNOWN</code>
for all unknown values. This can be solved in Piper by catching any <code>KeyError</code>s
when looking up a mapping&rsquo;s human readable representation, but it&rsquo;s better to
fix this in libratbag itself; which is why I opened <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/issues/281">this
issue</a>.</p>

<p>As for the second crash mentioned above, apparently there are some misconfigured
libratbag drivers that do not set an active resolution. In this case, Piper now
prints a message informing the user of a buggy driver and simply returns the
first resolution (or profile) it finds
(<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/122">#122</a>).</p>

<p>Cvuchener also found that the apply button was <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/123">switching state when going back
to and from the welcome screen</a>.
This was simply a case of me trying to be too smart for my own good, as you can
see <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/127">in the one line fix</a>.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/126">forgot to destroy old profiles when reusing the
MousePerspective</a> which led to
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/124">duplicate profile entries that crashed Piper when
clicked</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, cvuchener ran into timeouts when committing changes to his device,
which has been a reoccurring issue for myself as well. My mentor and I had
discussed async commits before, but <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/issues/269">until libratbag supports
this</a> there isn&rsquo;t much that
Piper can do. Deciding on a proper timeout is difficult, as we</p>

<ol>
<li>do not know what happens when a user changes settings while old changes are
being committed (so we should strive to make it as small as possible?), and</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t know what value will be long enough not to cause timeouts. This depends
both on the device (including whether it&rsquo;s wireless or not, as for example my
G403 wired does not lead to timeouts but wireless it does) and the box
running Piper.</li>
</ol>

<p>We assume that DBus will cache any changes for us, and indeed it seems to work
just fine, so as a stop-gap until we get async commits the <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/129">timeout is now 2
seconds instead of half a second</a>.</p>

<p>This week we&rsquo;ve seen a bunch of users trying to run Piper. This is exciting
because it means we&rsquo;re doing work that people need! It is also good because they
run into issues that need fixing before we tag a release &#9786;</p>

<p>One such case is a user that <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/111">tried to run Piper with a too old Gtk
version</a>. This resulted in us
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/118">adding a check to Piper for the required Gtk
version</a>. Next, when that user
upgraded his Gtk version, he made libratbag recognize his device but forgot to
supply libratbag with a device SVG. Piper should have displayed the error
perspective in such a scenario, but it turned out that we <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/125">cannot raise
exceptions from GObject
properties</a>. After making this a
<q>real</q> setter method, the error perspective is now presented as it should.</p>

<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work-in-progress</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on a bunch of other issues that I can hopefully get merged
before the 21st of August, which marks the end of my Google Summer of Code. I
intend to keep working on Piper after the summer, but these are features I would
like to get in before we tag a release.</p>

<p>First, jimmac <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/77">requested</a> a search
field for the button mapping dialog. Today I opened the <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/143">pull
request</a> that adds this and makes
the dialog in general look just that bit nicer (compared with what I showed
<a href="/blog/gsoc-part-10">part 10</a>):</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="/img/blog/gsoc-part-13/search.webm" type="video/webm">

</video>

<p>Another GUADEC issue was to <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/80">highlight the active
resolution</a> in the resolutions
page. This was a <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/132">straightforward
change</a>, after having fixing
ratbagd (<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/pull/284">#284</a>). Here you can
see it in action:</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="/img/blog/gsoc-part-13/active-resolutions.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>As you can see, this activates the clicked resolution and thereby also fixes
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/81">that issue</a> (but ignores issue
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/72">#72</a>). This approach should also
work towards being able to display and set the default resolution, <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/36">a pull
request</a> that has been WIP since
July 11.</p>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, is that Piper can now be
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/pull/137">translated</a> into your native (or
not!) language! Here you can see Piper in Dutch:</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="/img/blog/gsoc-part-13/piper-dutch.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>As you can see, not everything is translated yet. There is something weird going
on with all strings that are translated and retrieved from a map; I have yet to
figure this one out. We also cannot yet run with local translations: for now
you&rsquo;ll have to install Piper in order to test your translations. I also intend
to add more context for translators so it is easier to see how to translate some
strings, and I intend to get this merged only after all the UI work is done so
we are sure to catch all strings.</p>

<p>Barring any newly discovered crashes, there are only three more issues to solve
before my deadline: <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/140">a crash resulting from libratbag returning its error code
1001</a>, <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/141">correctly restoring the
macro preview label</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/142">fixing
the initial window size</a>.</p>

<p>This blog post is part of a <a href="/series/google-summer-of-code/">series</a>. You can read the next part about the final
changes <a href="/blog/gsoc-part-14">here</a> or the previous part about the finishing
touches <a href="/blog/gsoc-part-12">here</a>.</p>
