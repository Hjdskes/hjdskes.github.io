      <title>Deploying a Nixified Haskell binary on AWS Lambda</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/haskell-nix-aws-lambda/</link>

      <description>For a current project (which I will be writing about soon!), I need to deploy a Haskell binary to AWS Lambda. Since Haskell is not officially supported, I needed to jump through some hoops in order to run my code. Thankfully, there is a great library out there that allows Haskell code to interface with AWS Lambda, so that part of the problem is solved. The problem that remains is to get AWS Lambda to run my Haskell binary.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I sat down and wrote an article for this blog. I had always thought that working from home would be the dream, but now that I am forced to live that dream it it isn&amp;rsquo;t all that I thought it would be. Probably it&amp;rsquo;d be different if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t required to and could live my private life as I normally would, but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.</description>

      <title>Giving up maintainership of Piper and Gcolor3</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/giving-up-piper-gcolor3/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/giving-up-piper-gcolor3/</guid>
      <description>Today, I handed over the maintainership of Gcolor3 to Christopher Davis, also known as Brainblasted. As you may have noticed, I have little time (and to be honest, little interest) to keep Gcolor3 up to date.
Gcolor3 was my first project and still a project I&amp;rsquo;m proud of, but it is time for me to move on. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to give over the maintainership, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best thing to do for both the project and myself: users shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait days or weeks for me to respond, and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to feel guilty and pressured whenever I get a notification.</description>

      <title>An update on HTTPS certificate issues</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/https-update/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/https-update/</guid>
      <description>For a little over a year now, this website has been enforcing HTTPS over both its www subdomain and the hjdskes.nl apex domain. These certificates are kindly provided automagically by GitHub in a partnership with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
In May, the certificate for my website expired. Expecting GitHub to be on top of this, at first I did not take any action. Some of you have reached out to me about the issue, which prompted me to contact GitHub to figure out why my certficate wasn&amp;rsquo;t being renewed.</description>

      <title>Cage 0.1.1 is out</title>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/cage-0.1.1/</guid>
      <description>Just a quick notification to anyone following this website for Cage updates: I just released Cage 0.1.1. This release serves mostly for packagers that want to package Cage with wlroots 0.6.0, such as the Arch Linux packagers.
As such, not too much has changed between 0.1 and 0.1.1:
 Cage now drops root on startup on systems without (e)logind support (such as FreeBSD). The XKB_* environment variables can now be used to configure keyboard devices.</description>

      <description>Almost exactly four months ago I announced Cage, my Wayland compositor for a kiosk-like environment. To the uninitiated: a kiosk is designed for running a single, maximized application and preventing the user from interacting with any other part of the system. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen many in your life in malls, stores or even the dentist (how satisfied are you with your service?). Kiosks can also be used for much cooler things, though, such as running home automation systems.</description>

      <title>An update from GitHub on PGP subkeys</title>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/github-pgp-response/</guid>
      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about adding a new PGP subkey to your GitHub account. I reported this issue to GitHub when I discovered it. Today, I have gotten a response from GitHub:
 When a new subkey is added to an existing PGP key on an account, it currently has to be removed and added back to the account to update it on our side.
This is expected behaviour for now but I agree it isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elegant solution!</description>

      <description>Back in May I wrote that I was thinking of some home automation projects. However, what fun would it be to buy readily made products? And, more importantly, what would the quality of those products be? We all know that many IoT products are insecure and privacy invading and leave you depending on the manufacturer for updates. Finally, home automation is an excellent learning project. It encompasses so many different technologies, both high- and low-level.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I made Cage publically available. Cage is a kiosk for Wayland. A kiosk is designed for running a single, maximized application and preventing the user from interacting with any other part of the system. You can read more about Cage on its project page.
I developed Cage as part of my home automation project. This is a hobby and learning project where I build my own, well, home automation system (from scratch, i.</description>

      <title>A purpose-built Linux OS for my Raspberry Pi 3B&#43; home automation system</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/rpi-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/rpi-linux/</guid>
      <description>For my home automation system I developed a purpose-built (minimal, embedded) Linux-based operating system.
This embedded Linux distribution is built using Buildroot. To house my configuration, I forked Buildroot on GitHub. I added a custom defconfig (configs/hjdskes_rpi3_defconfig) that holds my image&amp;rsquo;s configuration, and there is a subdirectory in board/hjdskes/rpi3/ to hold configuration files and a rootsfs overlay.
The system is very minimal and modern: on top of the Linux kernel, it installs systemd (only the required parts and logind), util-linux&#39; agetty and login, bash, Raspberry Pi firmware, wpa_supplicant, mesa (Gallium VC4 driver, OpenGL ES and EGL), GTK+ 3, my Wayland compositor Cage, the Cantarell font and the Adwaita icon theme.</description>

      <title>PSA: want to use a new subkey to sign your commits?</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/psa-github-gpg/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/blog/psa-github-gpg/</guid>
      <description>I not so recently started using subkeys to do my normal PGP work. I made a new subkey specifically for signing things, and naturally wanted to use this new key to sign my commits with git&amp;rsquo;s builtin GPG support. I picked up my subkey&amp;rsquo;s ID with gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG and set it with git config --global user.signingKey &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;. That&amp;rsquo;d be it, right?
Since you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ve found out the answer is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Cage: the Wayland kiosk</title>

      <description>Cage is a kiosk compositor for Wayland. A kiosk is a window manager (in the X11 world) or compositor (in the Wayland world) that is designed for a user experience wherein user interaction and activities outside the scope of the running application are prevented. That is, a kiosk compositor displays a single maximized application at a time and prevents the user from interacting with anything but this application.
As such, user input such as moving, resizing, minimizing and unmaximizing windows is ignored.</description>

      <title>MSc thesis: Abstract Interpretation of Program Transformations using Regular Tree Grammars</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/msc/</link>

      <description>I completed my MSc thesis at the Programming Languages group of the TU Delft under the supervision of Dr. S.T. Erdweg and Sven Keidel.
Program transformations translate code of an input language to code of an output language. Examples of program transformations are desugarings, optimizations and refactorings. Developers of program transformations need to ensure correctness of their programs. For example, for a desugaring we would want to know whether all sugar constructs have been removed after the transformation.</description>

      <description>I was cleaning up old GitHub repositories and came across old patches for GNOME screenshot (see below). In an attempt to upstream them once more, I found that most of these fixes had already found their way into GNOME screenshot, except one. I opened a merge request for that patch, which was accepted after a small change.</description>

      <description>Gcolor3 has moved from GitHub to GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab instance! You can now find the repository at https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3. This was suggested by GNOME developer Jeremy Bicha and finalized very quickly by Carlos Soriano, thanks both!
Being on GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab is awesome, because Gcolor3 is now surrounded by other GNOME projects. This should make it easier to find for many people, but there are other benefits too. Since the move yesterday, I have already received nine merge requests!</description>

      <description>Finally, after a long period of sporadic commits, I released Gcolor3 version 2.3 out into the wild!
          This release was two years in the making (two years and twelve days, to be precise). It features 67 commits, resulting in a redesigned saved colors page, a redesigned headerbar and loads of under-the-hood changes. In this post, I want to go into a little more detail on the development and what led up to Gcolor 2.</description>

Whilst I did not get notified through Troy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s excellent Have I Been Pwned?, now was a good a time as any to finally apply some proper password hygiene. A great time, even, as this has been on my to-do list for way too long. I have been preaching proper password hygiene to my family and friends whilst not yet practicing it myself!</description>

      <description>From today, my website enforces HTTPS again! Github Pages have been supporting HTTPS since June 2016, so when my website was reachable only through hjdskes.github.io I got all of that for free. In fact, because HTTPS is the future(tm), I enabled Github Pages&#39; enforce HTTPS feature in my website&amp;rsquo;s settings.
Since March, my website is also reachable through (www.)hjdskes.nl. When I set this up, I knew I would lose the ability to enforce HTTPS because up until yesterday, Github Pages did not support HTTPS for custom domains.</description>

      <description>A little less than a year ago I finished my home made server/NAS. I have been meaning to blog about the process since, but never got around to it. Since my MSc thesis is keeping my mind busy during the day, I wanted a project that was not programming to relax my mind after a long day. I decided to try my hand at something I had never done before and create my own 3D printed case.</description>

      <title>Piper: a GTK application to configure gaming mice</title>
      <link>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/piper/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/piper/</guid>
      <description>Piper is a graphical user interface to configure gaming mice. Configuration options include changing the resolution (DPI) of the mouse, adding and removing profiles, changing button behaviors and setting LED colors.
Piper requires libratbagâs ratbagd, the daemon to actually communicate with the mice. Piper is a just front end to ratbagd.
Installation We maintain a Wiki page where we keep up-to-date instructions on how to install Piper.</description>

      <description>This is the last entry in the Google Summer of Code series that I have been writing weekly for the last three months. It is different from the usual updates in that I won&amp;rsquo;t be discussing development progress: rather, this will be the submission report for the project as a whole. I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing the why? behind the project, the plan that my mentor and I came up with to execute the project, the work I have done over the summer including a video of the result, the things that are left to work on, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during the project and finally, the links to the code that I have written for the actual submission.</description>

      <description>This week I have been solving more issues to make sure that Piper offers a pleasent user experience, doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash and runs smoothly. My mentor and cvuchener from the libratbag project have been testing Piper the last week, and together with a handful of users attracted to Piper they have opened a bunch of issues for me to solve. Let&amp;rsquo;s run through the most visible ones!
Solving global warming Probably the most fun issue to resolve this week was the one reported by my mentor: Piper contributes to global warming (you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!</description>

      <description>Last week I shared the news that all large features had been implemented; all that was left were issues raised by GNOME contributors when my mentor demoed my progress over GUADEC. This week I&amp;rsquo;ve just been chugging away on those issues; let me show you.
Obvious save button is.. not obvious? Hadess noted that the save button wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious when my mentor demoed Piper to him; I already mentioned this last week: the icon is a save to diskicon and it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious at first glance that you have to press it to write the changes you made to the device.</description>

 A welcome screen, presenting a list of connected and supported devices. An error screen, presenting any problems in a user-friendly manner. The main screen, presenting the configuration pages: A page to configure resolutions (see part 7) A page to configure button mappings (see parts 9 and 10) A page to configure LEDs (see part 8) Support for device profiles (see part 9 for the start on this).</description>

      <description>I can start this blog post by sharing the news that I have passed for my second evaluation! This means that I&amp;rsquo;m now on the last sprint towards the finish line, with ahead of me profile support and the welcome screen.
Yes; you&amp;rsquo;ve read that correctly: I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the button page. I managed to fix that this week and it&amp;rsquo;s now pending review and some final issues (more about that below).</description>

      <description>When I discussed this project with my mentor before GSoC, he told me that the button mappings were going to be the most complicated piece. This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on precisely that and, well, let&amp;rsquo;s just say he wasn&amp;rsquo;t wrong ð
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along on GitHub, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that it was a slow week. Indeed, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been that much activity this week as in previous weeks.</description>

      <description>Originally the plan for this week was to start working on the button mappings, however together with my mentor I decided that it&amp;rsquo;s better to do the LEDs first. This is because I was sure I could finish this in a few days, and button mappings is definitely going to take much longer than that. So, this week I&amp;rsquo;ll run you through the implementation of the LED stack page, and the coming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on button mappings, profile support and a proper welcome screen, in that order.</description>

      <description>This week was a good week with loads of progress. I&amp;rsquo;ll just go through each item one by one, as usual.
MouseMap merged Last Friday I opened the pull request to merge the MouseMap widget. After a bit of a discussion around preferences, my mentor and I decided to merge ongoing work in a rewrite branch. This keeps the master branch functional (while still receiving improvements, such as adding new functionality to the ratbagd bindings or a Gtk.</description>

      <description>This week Piper saw some progress again! Today I opened the pull request for the MouseMap that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the past two and a half weeks now. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the changes made since the last blog later; first, I want to highlight the other work I did the past week.
A major milestone this week is the merging of ratbagd and libratbag. While Piper shouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice any of this (it talks to ratbagd over DBus), it&amp;rsquo;s still a highlight I want to mention.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in my previous blog, the X.Org Foundation now wants us to blog every week. Whilst that means shorter blogs (last week&amp;rsquo;s was a tad long), it also means that there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to blog about if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much in a week.
Such is the case for this week, sadly. It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of university, and so there are a few assignment deadlines that I needed to complete; I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to invest as much time into my project as I would have wanted.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a long one, so grab a drink and a snack and buckle up! Incidentally, the X.Org foundation has asked us, the 2017 GSoC students, to blog weekly so from now on I will do so; which will also mean smaller blogs in the future.
I made a schedule to go with my proposal in which I divided the coding period into two week sprints to plan out my project.</description>

      <description>This will be a quick blog post on the previous two weeks. During this time, the community bonding period ended and the coding phase officially begun!
I spent most of the first week working on university projects, so that those are as done as they can be at this point and I have little else to work on besides Piper.
On the second week, I thought I would get a few days head start on my schedule by starting early on the mockups.</description>

      <description>Two weeks have now passed since my introductory blog post, so as promised here is part two! The theme of this blog post is probably something along the lines of preparation, as that is what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing mostly.
The period between that of announcing the accepted student proposals and phase one is called the community bonding period. In this period students are supposed to get to know their mentors, their organizations, familiarize themselves with their projects (even more) and get everything ready to start off the coding period on May 30th.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, after waiting for what felt like a very long time, I finally got the results of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) application! I can happily say that one of my proposals has been accepted: I will work with Peter Hutterer to redesign and rewrite Piper. The synopsis of my proposal is as follows:
 Piper is an application frontend to libratbag and ratbagd, a library and system daemon to configure gaming mice respectively.</description>

      <description>The application process of Google Summer of Code requires students to make a small contribution to the project(s) of their choice to demonstrate that they are capable of making a change following the upstream submission procedures. In my understanding, this is less about the actual code than it is about demonstrating these skills. This is (partly, the other reason being that as I was working on these proposals I was also finishing up several course projects) the reason that the contributions here are rather small:</description>

This week I attempted to update the theme of this website. To pull in the theme&amp;rsquo;s files, I use git submodules. Apparently, this completely break git&amp;rsquo;s subtrees. I had enough of trying to maintain this complicated setup, so I started looking around for better ways.</description>

      <description>For the course Software Architecture at the TU Delft we were required to analyse and contribute to an existing open source project. The group I was part of chose Neovim as our project. The result of this analysis is a chapter in the book Delft Students on Software Architecture: 2017.
Our contributions resulted in several small fixes to both Neovim and Vim, namely Neovim commits by myself and Sander and Vim commits by myself.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/gtimeutils/</guid>
      <description>GTimeUtils is a collection of simple and small time utilities, namely a stopwatch and a (countdown) timer.
From version 2.0 onwards, both the timer and the stopwatch are of from GNOME Clocks&#39; respective stack pages. Prior to version 2.0, both utilities served more as a practice than anything else. Since I like the modern look of GNOME Clocks, but dislike the fact that all its functionality is combined into one application, I have re-purposed GNOME Clocks&#39; ui files into standalone utilities.</description>

      <description>Arek Window Manager is a plugin to Mutter in an (ambitious) attempt to create a tiling window manager with eye-candy. Due to several limitations on Mutter&amp;rsquo;s side, a moving Wayland target and a lack of time on my side, this project is not actively maintained at the moment.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/phosphorus/</guid>
      <description>Phosphorus is a wallpaper browser and setter in the spirit of Nitrogen. It can be considered an unofficial port of Nitrogen to GTK+ 3. Phosphorus is different, however, in that it is plugin-based.
Phosphorus, at its core, is agnostic to how the selected image is applied as wallpaper. There are many different Desktop Environments that all have their own way of applying wallpapers. Soon, with Wayland becoming stable, every lightweight compositor will have its own implementation as well.</description>

When you have found the perfect combination of colors, naturally you want to save them. Gcolor3 allows you to conveniently save and retrieve colors.</description>
