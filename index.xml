      <title>MSc thesis: Abstract Interpretation of Program Transformations using Regular Tree Grammars</title>
      <link>https://hjdskes.nl/projects/msc/</link>

      <description>I completed my MSc thesis at the Programming Languages group of the TU Delft under the supervision of Dr. S.T. Erdweg and Sven Keidel.
Program transformations translate code of an input language to code of an output language. Examples of program transformations are desugarings, optimizations and refactorings. Developers of program transformations need to ensure correctness of their programs. For example, for a desugaring we would want to know whether all sugar constructs have been removed after the transformation.</description>

      <title>Gcolor3 has moved to GNOME&#39;s GitLab!</title>

      <description>Gcolor3 has moved from GitHub to GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab instance! You can now find the repository at https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3. This was suggested by GNOME developer Jeremy Bicha and finalized very quickly by Carlos Soriano, thanks both!
Being on GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab is awesome, because Gcolor3 is now surrounded by other GNOME projects. This should make it easier to find for many people, but there are other benefits too. Since the move yesterday, I have already received nine merge requests!</description>

      <description>Finally, after a long period of sporadic commits, I released Gcolor3 version 2.3 out into the wild!
          This release was two years in the making (two years and twelve days, to be precise). It features 67 commits, resulting in a redesigned saved colors page, a redesigned headerbar and loads of under-the-hood changes. In this post, I want to go into a little more detail on the development and what led up to Gcolor 2.</description>

      <description>Last week, I received an email from Ticketmaster that my account details may have been leaked through an external supplier. Whilst I did not get notified through Troy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s excellent Have I Been Pwned?, now was a good a time as any to finally apply some proper password hygiene. A great time, even, as this has been on my to-do list for way too long. I have been preaching proper password hygiene to my family and friends whilst not yet practicing it myself!</description>

      <description>From today, my website enforces HTTPS again! Github Pages have been supporting HTTPS since June 2016, so when my website was reachable only through hjdskes.github.io I got all of that for free. In fact, because HTTPS is the future&amp;trade;, I enabled Github Pages&amp;rsquo; enforce HTTPS feature in my website&amp;rsquo;s settings.
Since March, my website is also reachable through (www.)hjdskes.nl. When I set this up, I knew I would lose the ability to enforce HTTPS because up until yesterday, Github Pages did not support HTTPS for custom domains.</description>

      <description>A little less than a year ago I finished my home made server/NAS. I have been meaning to blog about the process since, but never got around to it. Since my MSc thesis is keeping my mind busy during the day, I wanted a project that was not programming to relax my mind after a long day. I decided to try my hand at something I had never done before and create my own 3D printed case.</description>

      <title>Quadrupel: an embedded software project to stabilize a drone</title>

      <guid>https://hjdskes.nl/projects/quadrupel/</guid>
      <description>For the course IN4073 Embedded Real-Time Systems my project group and I had to program the software of an embedded control unit of a drone (dubbed the Quadrupel), to provide stabilization such that it can hover and fly with limited user control.
Our drone managed to take off, fly and land safely. Our response time was high enough for adequate stability, which we managed to do by:
 using a simple, custom message format on top of the COBS protocol to communicate between the base station (a PC) and the drone, sticking to a small and simple code base implementing a finite state machine, thoroughly reviewing each other&amp;rsquo;s pull requests.</description>

      <description>I redesigned and rewrote the Piper mouse configuration tool for the GNOME desktop environment under the guidance of Peter Hutterer from the X.Org Foundation. You can read the project page and browse the development series that I wrote during the project for more information.
As a result of my Google Summer of Code, I am now the maintainer of Piper. I also regularly contribute to its dependencies, libratbag and ratbagd.</description>

      <description>This is the last entry in the Google Summer of Code series that I have been writing weekly for the last three months. It is different from the usual updates in that I won&amp;rsquo;t be discussing development progress: rather, this will be the submission report for the project as a whole. I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing the why? behind the project, the plan that my mentor and I came up with to execute the project, the work I have done over the summer including a video of the result, the things that are left to work on, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during the project and finally, the links to the code that I have written for the actual submission.</description>

      <description>Well, this really is the last week of my Summer of Code! This will be a short update on the final changes made since my last update on Friday, which will be followed by a proper blog post for my final submission later this week.
Last week I mentioned a few items that were work-in-progress. The search field for the button mapping dialog has been merged, including its revamp of the dialog&amp;rsquo;s UI.</description>

      <description>This week I have been solving more issues to make sure that Piper offers a pleasent user experience, doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash and runs smoothly. My mentor and cvuchener from the libratbag project have been testing Piper the last week, and together with a handful of users attracted to Piper they have opened a bunch of issues for me to solve. Let&amp;rsquo;s run through the most visible ones!
Solving global warming Probably the most fun issue to resolve this week was the one reported by my mentor: Piper contributes to global warming (you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!</description>

      <description>Last week I shared the news that all large features had been implemented; all that was left were issues raised by GNOME contributors when my mentor demoed my progress over GUADEC. This week I&amp;rsquo;ve just been chugging away on those issues; let me show you.
Obvious save button is.. not obvious? Hadess noted that the save button wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious when my mentor demoed Piper to him; I already mentioned this last week: the icon is a save to disk icon and it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious at first glance that you have to press it to write the changes you made to the device.</description>

      <description>When I proposed the project with my mentor, we worked out a bunch of features that the new Piper should have. These are listed in the Redesign Wiki, but here&amp;rsquo;s a high-level summary:
 A welcome screen, presenting a list of connected and supported devices. An error screen, presenting any problems in a user-friendly manner. The main screen, presenting the configuration pages:  A page to configure resolutions (see part 7) A page to configure button mappings (see parts 9 and 10) A page to configure LEDs (see part 8)  Support for device profiles (see part 9 for the start on this).</description>

      <description>I can start this blog post by sharing the news that I have passed for my second evaluation! This means that I&amp;rsquo;m now on the last sprint towards the finish line, with ahead of me profile support and the welcome screen.
Yes; you&amp;rsquo;ve read that correctly: I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the button page. I managed to fix that this week and it&amp;rsquo;s now pending review and some final issues (more about that below).</description>

      <description>When I discussed this project with my mentor before GSoC, he told me that the button mappings were going to be the most complicated piece. This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on precisely that and, well, let&amp;rsquo;s just say he wasn&amp;rsquo;t wrong &amp;#128521;
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along on GitHub, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that it was a slow week. Indeed, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been that much activity this week as in previous weeks.</description>

      <description>Originally the plan for this week was to start working on the button mappings, however together with my mentor I decided that it&amp;rsquo;s better to do the LEDs first. This is because I was sure I could finish this in a few days, and button mappings is definitely going to take much longer than that. So, this week I&amp;rsquo;ll run you through the implementation of the LED stack page, and the coming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on button mappings, profile support and a proper welcome screen, in that order.</description>

      <description>This week was a good week with loads of progress. I&amp;rsquo;ll just go through each item one by one, as usual.
MouseMap merged Last Friday I opened the pull request to merge the MouseMap widget. After a bit of a discussion around preferences, my mentor and I decided to merge ongoing work in a rewrite branch. This keeps the master branch functional (while still receiving improvements, such as adding new functionality to the ratbagd bindings or a Gtk.</description>

      <description>This week Piper saw some progress again! Today I opened the pull request for the MouseMap that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the past two and a half weeks now. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the changes made since the last blog later; first, I want to highlight the other work I did the past week.
A major milestone this week is the merging of ratbagd and libratbag. While Piper shouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice any of this (it talks to ratbagd over DBus), it&amp;rsquo;s still a highlight I want to mention.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in my previous blog, the X.Org Foundation now wants us to blog every week. Whilst that means shorter blogs (last week&amp;rsquo;s was a tad long), it also means that there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to blog about if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much in a week.
Such is the case for this week, sadly. It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of university, and so there are a few assignment deadlines that I needed to complete; I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to invest as much time into my project as I would have wanted.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a long one, so grab a drink and a snack and buckle up! Incidentally, the X.Org foundation has asked us, the 2017 GSoC students, to blog weekly so from now on I will do so; which will also mean smaller blogs in the future.
I made a schedule to go with my proposal in which I divided the coding period into two week sprints to plan out my project.</description>

      <description>This will be a quick blog post on the previous two weeks. During this time, the community bonding period ended and the coding phase officially begun!
I spent most of the first week working on university projects, so that those are as done as they can be at this point and I have little else to work on besides Piper.
On the second week, I thought I would get a few days head start on my schedule by starting early on the mockups.</description>

      <description>For the course ET4307IN Advanced Network Security I had to develop an intrusion detection/prevention system. This system does the following:
 capture live data from the NIC and save data to / read data from a pcap file. capture and parse DNS packets according to RFC1035, with (as required) a custom parser. It gracefully ignores record types added in later versions of the DNS protocol. Log ARP packets (parsed with a custom parser, as required) that have generated an error or notice via a custom configuration.</description>

      <description>Two weeks have now passed since my introductory blog post, so as promised here is part two! The theme of this blog post is probably something along the lines of preparation, as that is what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing mostly.
The period between that of announcing the accepted student proposals and phase one is called the community bonding period. In this period students are supposed to get to know their mentors, their organizations, familiarize themselves with their projects (even more) and get everything ready to start off the coding period on May 30th.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, after waiting for what felt like a very long time, I finally got the results of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) application! I can happily say that one of my proposals has been accepted: I will work with Peter Hutterer to redesign and rewrite Piper. The synopsis of my proposal is as follows:
 Piper is an application frontend to libratbag and ratbagd, a library and system daemon to configure gaming mice respectively.</description>

      <description>The application process of Google Summer of Code requires students to make a small contribution to the project(s) of their choice to demonstrate that they are capable of making a change following the upstream submission procedures. In my understanding, this is less about the actual code than it is about demonstrating these skills. This is (partly, the other reason being that as I was working on these proposals I was also finishing up several course projects) the reason that the contributions here are rather small:</description>

This week I attempted to update the theme of this website. To pull in the theme&amp;rsquo;s files, I use git submodules. Apparently, this completely break git&amp;rsquo;s subtrees. I had enough of trying to maintain this complicated setup, so I started looking around for better ways.</description>

In this paper I attempted to map the use of free and open source software licenses, in order to see whether a developer&amp;rsquo;s geographic location is a determinant of FOSS license choice. If you are interested in reading the draft (it was never required to go further, and never did), please reach out to me and I will send it to you.</description>

      <description>For the course Software Architecture at the TU Delft we were required to analyse and contribute to an existing open source project. The group I was part of chose Neovim as our project. The result of this analysis is a chapter in the book Delft Students on Software Architecture: 2017.
Our contributions resulted in several small fixes to both Neovim and Vim:
 Neovim commits by myself and Sander; Vim commits by myself.</description>

      <description>The method described here is obsolete. The introduction still provides a nice overview of the problem, but please see my updated post for the actual steps and scripts!
 Hello, World!
As this is the first blog post on this website (and indeed, by myself), the introduction had to be done. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it at this, though. If you want to know more about me, you can do that here.</description>

      <description>I wrote some as of yet unmerged patches and opened some outstanding bug reports to GNOME Screenshot. You can review them here and here.
Last week (september 22, 2018), I was cleaning up old GitHub repositories and came across these patches again. In an attempt to upstream them once more, I found that most of these fixes had already found their way into GNOME screenshot, except one. I opened a merge request for that patch, which was accepted after a small change.</description>

      <description>Arek Window Manager is a plugin to Mutter in an (ambitious) attempt to create a tiling window manager with eye-candy. Due to several limitations on Mutter&amp;rsquo;s side, a moving Wayland target and a lack of time on my side, this project is not actively maintained at the moment.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus: a wallpaper browser and setter in the spirit of Nitrogen</title>

      <description>Phosphorus is a wallpaper browser and setter in the spirit of Nitrogen. It can be considered an unofficial port of Nitrogen to GTK+ 3. Phosphorus is different, however, in that it is plugin-based. This allows it be agnostic as to how the wallpaper is actually applied &amp;ndash; each Desktop Environment has its own plugin with this functionality.</description>

      <description>Ever wanted to know the value of that color on your screen? Gcolor3 enables you to pick the color from any pixel on your screen. It also offers a palette, so that you can easily mix and match a couple of colors together.
When you have found the perfect combination of colors, naturally you want to save them. Gcolor3 allows you to conveniently save and retrieve colors.</description>
