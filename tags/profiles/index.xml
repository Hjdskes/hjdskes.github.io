      <description>When I proposed the project with my mentor, we worked out a bunch of features that the new Piper should have. These are listed in the Redesign Wiki, but here&#39;s a high-level summary:
 A welcome screen, presenting a list of connected and supported devices. An error screen, presenting any problems in a user-friendly manner. The main screen, presenting the configuration pages: A page to configure resolutions (see part 7) A page to configure button mappings (see parts 9 and 10) A page to configure LEDs (see part 8) Support for device profiles (see part 9 for the start on this).</description>

      <description>I can start this blog post by sharing the news that I have passed for my second evaluation! This means that I&#39;m now on the last sprint towards the finish line, with ahead of me profile support and the welcome screen.
Yes; you&#39;ve read that correctly: I didn&#39;t mention the button page. I managed to fix that this week and it&#39;s now pending review and some final issues (more about that below).</description>
