      <description>Gcolor3 has moved from GitHub to GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab instance! You can now find the repository at https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3. This was suggested by GNOME developer Jeremy Bicha and finalized very quickly by Carlos Soriano, thanks both!
Being on GNOME&amp;rsquo;s GitLab is awesome, because Gcolor3 is now surrounded by other GNOME projects. This should make it easier to find for many people, but there are other benefits too. Since the move yesterday, I have already received nine merge requests!</description>
