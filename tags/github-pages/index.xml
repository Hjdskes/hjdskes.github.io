      <description>In my previous post I explained the workflow I use to update this website. It has never been particularly stable, and the process seemed far more complicated than it needed to be.
This week I attempted to update the theme of this website (sidenote: thanks Alexis Tacnet for your awesome theme and cooperation!). To pull in the theme&amp;rsquo;s files, I use git submodules. Apparently, this completely break git&amp;rsquo;s subtrees. I had enough of trying to maintain this complicated setup, so I started looking around for better ways.</description>

      <description>The method described here is obsolete. The introduction still provides a nice overview of the problem, but please see my updated post for the actual steps and scripts!
 &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;
As this is the first blog post on this website (and indeed, by myself), the introduction had to be done. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it at this, though. If you want to know more about me, you can do that here.</description>
