      <description>This is the last entry in the Google Summer of Code series that I have been writing weekly for the last three months. It is different from the usual updates in that I won&amp;rsquo;t be discussing development progress: rather, this will be the submission report for the project as a whole. I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing the why? behind the project, the plan that my mentor and I came up with to execute the project, the work I have done over the summer including a video of the result, the things that are left to work on, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during the project and finally, the links to the code that I have written for the actual submission.</description>
