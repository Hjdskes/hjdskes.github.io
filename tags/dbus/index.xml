      <description>Originally the plan for this week was to start working on the button mappings, however together with my mentor I decided that it&#39;s better to do the LEDs first. This is because I was sure I could finish this in a few days, and button mappings is definitely going to take much longer than that. So, this week I&#39;ll run you through the implementation of the LED stack page, and the coming weeks I&#39;ll be working on button mappings, profile support and a proper welcome screen, in that order.</description>
